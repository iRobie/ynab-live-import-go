# YNAB live import


## Credits

This repository is basically a clone of [buzzlawless/ynab-live-import](https://github.com/buzzlawless/ynab-live-import).
I wanted to learn Go and Terraform more, so I implemented buzzlawless' idea in these languages. 

Typing in Dynamo manually:

```json
{
  "Amount": 12.34,
  "Date": "2020-10-15",
  "LastDigits": 1234,
  "Merchant": "Fake merchant",
  "messageID": "asdfasdfasdf"
}
```
